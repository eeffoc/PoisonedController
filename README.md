# PoisonedController
A HTML, CSS and JavaScript only controller for using and controlling up to three accounts for the "Stream Defence (by ArchonTheWizard)" live multiplayer tower defence game hosted on Twitch. The live, most up to date version of the controller can be accessed [here](http://www.poisonedcontroller.stream/) or can be downloaded and run locally.

## F.A.Q.
Here are some common questions people have been asking, if you have issues with the controller give them a read.

**Q: How do I get the oauth for the second account?**
**A:** You can open a new incognito window in Chrome (or equivalent depending on your browser), go to the link address and log-in with your second account to get the code. Second option is go to Twitch, sign out and log-in using your second account and then go to the link address.

**Q: I keep getting the timeout error that my username might be incorrect but I am sure it is correct**
**A:** This is usually occurs on new accounts, play with that account normally in browser and complete at least one boss and then whisper the bot (TTDBot) "!specs" (without the quotes). If you have already played with this account try only doing step two.
